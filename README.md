## Wind Module
This module is part of the NOWCAST proyect by [ESO](https://www.eso.org) that aims to do short-term-forecast of the [seeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_seeing) parameter in order to improve astronomical observations. This module can handle the wind data given by the [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) as csv files.


## How it works

### Setup
The first thing tyou have to do is taking all the wind files and put them in the folder ``files2reformat``. They have to have the structure specified in ``files2reformat/README.md``.

In the folder ``correlation_df_file`` you have to put the file ``max_corr_df.correlations`` generated by the [``correlation_module``](https://github.com/tomasrojasc/correlation-module-nowcast)

You also have to fill the configuration in the ``modules/config.py`` file, that specifies all the required information for the program to run properly.

### Execution

Once That is done, you have to execute the ``main.py`` file. This file will do the following:

  * It will create a ``wind_data.df`` binary in the folder ``final_output``: This file is a pandas dataframe with all the information from the different files in one file.
  * It will create a ``numpy_data.matrice`` binary in the folder ``final_output``: This file is dictionary with different data matrices having data for plot.

### Internals
This module basically takes all the correlation data and the wind data together. With the wind data, per each layer, does an estimation of the time required for a signal to travel at the speed of that layer and in the direction of that layer, from site 1 to site 2 and stores everything in a dictionary for latter visualization
